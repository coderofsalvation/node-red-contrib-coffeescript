node-red-node-coffee
====================

This is a similar node to the 'function'-node, which allows custom javascript to be executed (in a sandbox).
This node will allow the enduser to use beautifull compact (sandboxed) coffeescript.

# Installation

Run: 

    npm install node-red-node-coffeescript

# Extra notes

I love Node-red!
